# CANCER-BIOMARKER

1.Introduction

About Cancer BioMarker

The study investigates the application of machine learning for identifying biomarkers in cancer diagnosis. Biomarkers play a vital role in providing insights into cancer presence, progression, and treatment response. By analyzing diverse biological data, including genomics, proteomics, and clinical variables, machine learning algorithms can uncover patterns and identify potential cancer-related biomarkers. The research integrates multi-omics data, employs feature selection techniques, and trains various machine learning models. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning in accurately classifying cancer cases and healthy controls, with potential associations to specific cancer subtypes. This research has implications for improving cancer detection, personalized treatment, and the advancement of precision medicine

2.Methodology

i. About Dataset

The most significant biomarkers for cancer diagnosis will be identified using machine learning (ML) algorithms, according to this study. A very high-dimensional dataset that reflects several cancer biomarkers was employed in this study's data analysis. The research's dataset includes a substantial number of samples and attributes. It comprises analyses of the protein concentrations and gene expressions of numerous cancer biomarkers. The information came from a publicly accessible database.

ii. About Cancer BioMarker Prediction System

A biomarker cancer prediction system is a computational strategy that utilizes machine learning methods to analyze and interpret biological indicators, known as biomarkers, to predict the presence or likelihood of cancer in individuals. Biomarkers are measurable markers, such as genetic mutations, protein expression levels, metabolite concentrations that provide insights into different aspects of cancer development, progression, or response to treatment. By analyzing and integrating these biomarkers using machine learning algorithms, predictive models can be developed to estimate an individual's risk of developing cancer or to classify tumor subtypes.
